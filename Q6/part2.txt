Part 2
Binh would like to see how openings compare. The function def win_loss_by_opening(games: list[dict]) -> dict: should take as input a list of games in dictionary format, and return a dictionary with a key for each opening in the dataset and for the values a tuple containing the number of games won by white, followed by the number of games won by black. For example, the file example.pgn contains nine games that use the opening 'Van't Kruijs Opening'. Three of these games are a win for white, 1-0, 6 wins for black, 0-1. This means that your dictionary should contain a key 'Van't Kruijs Opening' with the value (3, 6).
